			The team was founded in 1917 and were called the Toronto Arenas. In 1919, it was renamed to the Toronto St. Patricks. At last, the team was purchased by Conn Smythe which was then renamed to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The team&rsquo;s jersey&rsquo;s 
			have also been altered throughout the changes. The team has won 13 Stanley Cup championships throughout the team&rsquo;s career. The team won their last Stanley Cup championship in 1967 having the longest drought between championships in the NHL. The 
			Toronto Maple Leafs are currently affiliated with the Toronto Marlies of the AHL (American Hockey League). The team&rsquo;s first home arena was the Arena Gardens in 1917 and Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931. Their home arena then went to the Air Canada 
			Center now known as the Scotiabank Arena. Visit the current games that the Toronto Maple Leafs are <a href="https://www.nhl.com/mapleleafs">playing.</a>
