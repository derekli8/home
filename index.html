      <p>
      Historical records show primitive forms of hockey in Egypt four thousand years ago with curved sticks and a projectile. Museums provide evidence that primitive forms of the game were played by the Romans
      and the Greeks. The more modern form of hockey appeared in England in the mid-18th century and the first Hockey Association was formed in the United Kingdom in 1876 with the first set of game rules. The
      first organized and recorded game of hockey played indoors was in Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec on March 3, 1875. In the 19th century, more forms and divisions of the sport started to differentiate, and 
      eventually, integrated into a similar style of the modern sport of hockey. Organizations dedicated to the making of formal rules and regulations began to form. With time, national and international hockey 
      associations materialized.

      Hockey is a high contact team sport where two teams play against each other with the objective to maneuver and shoot a puck using a stick into the opponent&rsquo;s goal in respect of the sport&rsquo;s 
      <a href="#Hockey-Rules">rules</a>. (A puck is a 170-gram vulcanized rubber disc that has a three-inch diameter and is one inch thick.) Hockey is played on the ice in a hockey rink with six players on the 
      ice per side during normal play. These six players are usually divided into three forwards, two defensemen, and a goaltender. Each goal is worth one point with the team that scores the most goals being the 
      winner of that hockey game. In the NHL, if a team wins, they receive two points in the league standings, if a team loses in overtime or shootout, they will receive one point, and if a team loses in regulation, 
      they receive no points. In a professional hockey game, there are three periods, twenty minutes each. The clock runs only when the puck is in play and paused at any stoppage of play. The team&rsquo;s change ends 
      after each period. If a tie occurs at the end of the three periods, overtime will proceed in which the teams will play a five-minute sudden-death period with only three players on the ice and a goalie. If no 
      goals are scored during overtime, a shootout will occur. Shootouts start with three players from both teams taking alternating penalty shots. After these six penalty shots, the team with the most goals is 
      declared the winner and receives the extra goal. (If the game was tied 1-1, and the shootout was 3-2, the game is shown as 2-1.) If the shootout score is still tied, the shootout proceeds with sudden death until, 
      within a round, one team scores and the other team misses.

      A professional hockey rink is a rectangle like structure with the edges rounded. The rink is 200 by 85 feet in terms of the rectangular shape and the corners have a radius of 28 feet. The goal lines are 11 feet 
      from the end boards. The blue lines are 75 feet from the end boards and are 50 feet apart. The boards surrounding the rink, which are the boundaries of play, are 42 inches off the ice. The glass on top of the boards 
      are 5 feet along both sides of the rink and 8 feet at the ends of the rink. There is also protective netting on both ends of the rink that extend to the ceiling of the arena to protect spectators from misdirected 
      pucks.

      Goalie screens. Screens in hockey is when an attacking player is in front of the defending goalie in hopes of the goalie losing sight of the puck or having a harder time tracking the puck. This is so that it is easier 
      to score. Deflections. Deflections are when an attacking player redirects a shot or pass with their stick towards the goal. This is usually the player who screens the goalie&rsquo;s job. This is so that the goalie has 
      minimal time to react to the deflection as it is right in front of them. Deflections are usually either from a shot going wide of the net deflecting it into the net or knocking the puck down from a high shot. 
      “Pulling the goalie”. When a team is down by one or two goals towards the end of the game, they may decide to remove the goalie and replace it with an extra attacker. This is in hopes of gaining enough advantage, as 
      it would be 6 on 5, to score and tie the game up for overtime. This is a desperation tactic as the opposing team would have an empty net to shoot and score at as soon as they obtain possession. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="Hockey-Rules"> Basic Hockey Rules </h2> 
      <p> 
      Offside rule. Offside in hockey is when a team member is in the offensive zone before the puck is brought in by of his teammates. A delayed offside is when a player is in the offensive zone before the puck and the 
      attacking team causes the puck into the offensive zone without having possession. The linesman, one of the four referees, will put and keep their arm up to signal the infraction until all attacking players are out 
      of the offensive zone. Icing rule. Icing in hockey is when a player shoots the puck before the center line into the offensive zone without any player touching it. When this infraction occurs, the linesman will stop 
      play and it will resume at a faceoff in the defensive zone of the team with the infraction. Basic rules. Players can redirect the puck with any part of their body, but they cannot hold the puck in their hand. They however 
      may catch the puck out of the air and drop it to themselves. Players cannot intentionally use a part of their body to redirect the puck into the net like intentional kicking. Unintentional redirections of the puck 
      from the body into the net are permitted. The puck is out of play when it leaves the perimeter of the rink whether it goes onto a team&rsquo;s bench or going over the glass.
      </p>
      <h3> Penalties </h3> 
      <p>
      Infractions of the game rules lead to a stoppage of play. When an infraction is made, the main referees will signal the infraction. In most circumstances, the player who committed the infraction is sent to the penalty box 
      and their team will have to play “short-handed” (being down one player) for a period of time. Most penalties that occur are minor penalties that last for two minutes. Double minors are four minutes and major penalties are 
      five minutes. Minor penalties are assessed for lesser infractions like tripping, hooking, slashing, cross-checking, high-sticking etc. There are also minor penalties for delay of game for a player who shoots the puck over 
      the glass and out of play with no deflections. Double minor penalties last for two consecutive two-minute penalties. This is usually when blood is drawn from high-sticking. Major penalties are assessed for violent 
      circumstances like having the intent to injure. Instances like cross-checking to the head or checks from behind will result in major penalties. Full list of penalties <a href="https://www.hockeymonkey.com/learn/hockey-penalties">here.</a>
